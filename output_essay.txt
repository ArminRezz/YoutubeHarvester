actually get cursor control so
actually get cursor control so
actually get cursor control so
calibrating what's going on in my brain
calibrating what's going on in my brain

to uh translate that into cursor control
to uh translate that into cursor control

minutes and 15 minutes uh the models
minutes and 15 minutes uh the models
minutes and 15 minutes uh the models
will progressively get better and um so
